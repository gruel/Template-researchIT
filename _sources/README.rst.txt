Sphinx syntax
=============

Sphinx documentation system is based on the `reStructuredText syntax <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/rest.html>`_
which is very similar to Markdown.

Recently the possibility to use Markdown instead (or in complement) of reStructuredText using the Marlkdown flavor `CommonMark <http://recommonmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_. 
We should notice that the Markdown syntax is more limited than the reStructuredText one.

It is possible to mix reStructuredText and Markdown files in the same Sphinx documentation.
